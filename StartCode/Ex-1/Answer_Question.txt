Q1: When using the native HTTP module, some challenges include:
- Complex routing setup requiring manual URL parsing
- Need to handle request methods (GET, POST, etc.) explicitly
- More verbose error handling
- No built-in middleware support
- Manual handling of request body parsing

Q2: Express simplifies route handling compared to native HTTP server by:
- Providing intuitive routing methods (app.get(), app.post(), etc.)
- Built-in route parameter handling
- Chain-able route handlers
- Automatic header handling
- Built-in support for different response types (json, send, etc.)

Q3: Middleware in Express is:
- Functions that have access to request, response objects and next function
- Can modify request/response objects
- Can end request-response cycle
- Can call next middleware function

To replicate middleware using native HTTP:
- Would need to manually create a middleware chain
- Implement custom function handling for each middleware step
- Manually pass request/response objects between functions
- Create your own next() function implementation
